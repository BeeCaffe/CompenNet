End-to-end Projector Photometric Compensation (to appear in CVPR'19)
<br><br>
===


![result1](doc/img_3.png)

## Introduction
PyTorch implementation of [CompenNet][1].

Highlights:
* For the first time, we formulate the compensation problem as an end-to-end learning problem and propose a convolutional neural network, named **CompenNet**, to implicitly learn the complex compensation function.
* A novel evaluation benchmark, which is independent of system setup and thus quantitatively verifiable. Such benchmark is not previously available.
* Our method is evaluated carefully on the benchmark, and the results show that our end-to-end learning solution outperforms state-of-the-arts both qualitatively and quantitatively by a significant margin.

For more info please refer to our [CVPR'19 paper][1] and [supplementary material][2].




## Prerequisites
* PyTorch compatible GPU
* Python 3
* PyTorch >= 0.4.0
* opencv-python 3.4.4
* visdom (for visualization)

## Usage
### 

1. Clone this repo:
   
        git clone https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/CompenNet
        cd CompenNet

2. Install required packages by typing
   
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    

3. Download CompenNet [benchmark dataset][3] and extract to [`CompenNet/data`](data)

        
4. Start **visdom** by typing

        visdom

5. Once visdom is successfully started, visit [`http://localhost:8097`](http://localhost:8097)
6. Run [`main.py`](src/python/main.py) to start training and testing

        python main.py
7. The training and validation results are updated in the browser during training. An example is shown below, where the 1st figure shows the training and validation loss, rmse and ssim curves. The 2nd and 3rd montage figures are the training and validation pictures, respectively. In each montage figure, the **1st row are the camera captured uncompensated images, the 2nd row are CompenNet predicted projector input images and the 3rd row are ground truth projector input image**.

## Apply CompenNet to your own setup

1. For a planar textured projection surface, adjust the camera-projector such that the brightest projected input image (plain white) slightly overexposes the camera captured image. Similarly, the darkest projected input image (plain black) slightly underexposes the camera captured image. This allows the projector dynamic range to cover the full camera dynamic range.
2. Project and capture the images in `CompenNet/data/train` and `CompenNet/data/test`.
3. Project and capture a surface image `CompenNet/data/ref/img_gray`.
4. Project and capture a [checkerboard image](doc/checkerboard.png).
5. Estimate the homography `H` between camera and projector image, then warp the camera captured images `train`, `test` and `img_gray` to projector's view using `H`. 
6. Finally save the warped images to `CompenNet/data/light[n]/pos[m]/warp/train`,  `CompenNet/data/light[n]/pos[m]/warp/test` and  `CompenNet/data/light[n]/pos[m]/warp/ref`, respectively, where `[n]` and `[m]` are lighting setup index and position setup index.

----
## Implement your own CompenNet model
1. Create a new class e.g, `CompenNetImproved` in [`CompenNetModel.py`](src/python/CompenNetModel.py).
2. Put the new class name string in `model_list`, e.g., `model_list = [CompenNet, CompenNetImproved]` in [`main.py`](src/python/main.py).
3. Run `main.py`.
4. The validation results will be saved to `%Y-%m-%d_%H_%M_%S.txt` as shown below.
